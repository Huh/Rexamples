# Rexamples

This repository contains R code snippets created from specific questions asked of me and hopefully reflecting common tasks performed by wildlifers.

The scripts in this repository may be written quickly and so may not reflect the most elegant solutions, but I hope to use best practices and encourage other contirbutors to do the same.  For those scripts written with the intent to explain concepts the code is likely far too linear and verbose to be useful in actual analyses (per my obsessive practices and preferences).  What this means is that the code is not always organized in functions, modular or otherwise meant to be part of a larger workflow.

###Updating Scripts
Updates to any and all scripts are welcome.  Please use a GitHub pull request if you have something to add to this repository.

###Suggestions for New Scripts
If you have a suggestion for a new script please use the issue tracker to make the request and I will get to it or ask someone else to at our earliest convenience.

###Update Notifications
If you would like to get updates on this repository please click on the watch button at the top of the screen or follow me (Huh).

###I Want My Own Copy
The best way to add these scripts to your code library is to fork this repository.

###Warranty
There is no express or implied warranty that any of this code works and if you find an error please use the issue tracker (**NOT EMAIL**) to report the bug.  If you report a bug include a reproducible example of the error or your request may be ignored.

###Use of Code
Feel free to use any of the code in this repository as you see fit.

_Hope this is useful, Josh_
